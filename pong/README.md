# Pong

A recreation of the classic computer game using JavaScript and the HTML canvas.

To play the game, go to https://thfm.github.io/pong/. To play offline, download the source code and open ```index.html``` in a web browser.

## How to play

Simply move your mouse inside the game canvas to control the player (the paddle on the left). The paddle on the right is computer-controlled.

Note that the ball will speed up slightly each time it hits a paddle, until it hits a maximum speed limit.
