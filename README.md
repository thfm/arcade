## Controls & game logic

### Breakout

Move your mouse inside the game canvas to control the paddle. The aim is to deflect the ball so that it hits the coloured bricks, breaking them. You win if all of the bricks have been destroyed.

### Pong

Use the mouse (as in 'Breakout') to control the player (the paddle on the left). The paddle on the right is computer-controlled. You win a point if you hit the ball past the computer's paddle, and vice versa.

Note that the ball will speed up slightly each time it hits a paddle, until it reaches a maximum speed limit.

### Snake

Use the arrow keys to move the snake around inside the grid. If the head of the snake touches the apple (the red grid square), then it will grow slightly longer. The snake will die if it's head touches a wall or one of it's own segments. The aim of the game is to have the longest snake you can whilst keeping it alive.
