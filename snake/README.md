To play, head to https://thfm.github.io/snake/. Alternatively – if you wish to play offline – you can download the source code and open the  ```index.html``` file in a web browser.

# How to play

Use the arrow keys to move the snake around inside the grid. If the head of the snake touches the apple (the red grid square), then it will grow slightly longer. The snake will die if it's head touches a wall or one of it's own segments. The aim of the game is to have the longest snake you can whilst keeping it alive.
